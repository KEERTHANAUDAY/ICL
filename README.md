This tool the design space of modular timber slab and column systems. The main goal is to guide the user toward identifying structural configurations that satisfy the serviceability Limit State (SLS) deflection criteria from the early design stage. The routine workflow of performing SLS checks after completing the detailed design is not only time-consuming but also presents an environmental problem. Further, the opportunity to influence the structural material quantities and ensure future adaptability is lost. To address this issue, this thesis introduces a design method to explore low environmental impact configurations of column-slab positioning and sizing; while achieving the SLS deflection criteria. A guidance-based real-time FEA feedback design tool is developed to test the proposed method.
